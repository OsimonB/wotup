# Project Roadmap
I work full time so I don't have much time to work no this project. It's a project I've taken on as a favour for [Xisuma](https://www.twitch.tv/xisuma),
so this is really just a list of what features I plan on adding and when I need to add them.
This is nothing concrete so things are likely to change.
Releases will also most likely not be released one by one, but in chunks.
For example, if I finish all the features for Version 0.3 - 0.5 in one weekend, I will just release
version 0.5 not the in between stages, there is really no need to release every single stage.
