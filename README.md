# Wotup
**Wotup** is a stripped back bare essentials version of the Twitch chat design to enhance readability and further engage streamers with their viewers

### About
 Twitch Chat **Wotup** *(With Only The Useful Parts)* was originally created for [Xisuma](https://www.twitch.tv/xisuma). 
 He was after a chat client for Twitch that was easier to read especially when the chat was especially active.
 This project is designed to be that chat client, making it easier for streamers to be actively engaged with viewers.

 The application is built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) using [AngularJS](https://www.angularjs.org/) as a Javascript framework.
 UIs and layouts are done using [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) to give it a familiar and simplistic feel.
 Twitch features are integrated using [tmi.js](https://www.tmijs.org/) *(Absolutely amazing! Thanks tmi.js team!)*
